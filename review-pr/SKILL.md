  Review a pull request by dispatching specialized sub-agents in parallel
  (default: pr-review-toolkit's 6 agents — code-reviewer, comment-analyzer,
  silent-failure-hunter, pr-test-analyzer, type-design-analyzer,
  code-simplifier — with graceful fallback to single-pass review if the

  then writes them to a file (auto pipeline + standalone) or interactively
  triages before posting (deep mode). Triggers on "review PR",
  "review this PR", "/review-pr [PR]", or when invoked automatically by
  implement-feature after PRs are created.

# Review PR

Run a comprehensive review of a GitHub pull request by dispatching
specialised sub-agents in parallel, aggregating their findings, and
either writing the result to a file (for downstream pipeline use) or
posting to the PR.

This skill is the entry point for the automated review pipeline (see
`plans.local/skills/skill-tighten-implement-feature-flow.md` for the
visual model). It is also runnable standalone — both as auto-mode
(post immediately) and deep-mode (interactive triage before posting).

## Args

```
/review-pr [PR] [--deep] [--pipeline]
```

- **`PR`** — optional PR number. If omitted, auto-detect from the
  current branch via `gh pr view --json number`. If auto-detect fails,
  ask.
- **`--deep`** — interactive triage before posting. Walk each finding
  with the user (post / edit / drop) before posting the agreed batch.
- **`--pipeline`** — auto-mode file write only; do not touch GitHub.
  Used by `implement-feature` Step 5a. Equivalent to setting
  `PIPELINE=1` env. Flag wins on conflict.

Mode resolution:

| `--deep` | `--pipeline` / `PIPELINE=1` | Mode            |
| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| set      | (ignored)                   | deep            |
| unset    | set                         | auto pipeline   |
| unset    | unset                       | auto standalone |

`--deep` and `--pipeline` are mutually exclusive in spirit; if both
appear, `--deep` wins (interactive intent always overrides
auto-mode).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load configuration

Resolve `review.yaml` in this order, first hit wins:

1. `<repo_root>/.claude/review.yaml` — repo-local. Resolved from
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
2. `~/.claude/review.yaml` — shared default.

An empty file is valid (skill uses defaults — see
`_shared/review.example.yaml` for the schema and defaults).

If neither file exists:

- **Standalone modes** (no `--pipeline`, no `PIPELINE=1`): proceed
  with `{}` and run defaults.
- **Pipeline mode**: skip silently with the message
  `review-pr not configured for pipeline use — create .claude/review.yaml to enable`.
  Auto-invocation should not run unwanted reviews against the user's
  PRs; the pipeline is opt-in per repo.

Defaults applied when keys are missing (see `review.example.yaml` for
documentation):

- `guidelines: []`
- `output_dir: plans.local/<repo>/`
- `severity_threshold: suggestion`
- `focus: []`
- `agents:` omitted → defaults
- `guidelines_mode: shared`
- `finding_overlap: group`

### Step 2: Identify the PR

In order:

1. CLI arg `<PR>` if provided.
2. `gh pr view --json number,title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName`
   on the current branch.
3. Ask the user.

Once identified, fetch:

```bash
gh pr diff <N>
gh pr view <N> --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName
```

If `gh pr diff` returns empty (e.g. PR closed, no commits), exit with
a clear message — do not dispatch agents against a non-diff.

### Step 3: Load guidelines

Read each path in `guidelines:` (resolved relative to the repo root)
and concatenate. Join with a blank line plus a path header so each
agent prompt can attribute rules:

```
# docs/engineering/code-review-guidelines.md
<contents>

# docs/typescript/style.md
<contents>
```

If `guidelines:` is empty or missing, proceed with no project
context. The dedicated guidelines-compliance agent (if configured)
is skipped silently when there are no guidelines (see
`references/guidelines-agent.md`).

### Step 4: Resolve sub-agents

Apply the rules in `references/agents.md`:

- **`agents:` omitted** → try the 6 pr-review-toolkit defaults. Probe
  the plugin with one Task call (e.g. `code-reviewer`); on
  `unknown subagent_type`, fall back to single-pass review using
  `references/review-prompt.md` and emit the info line.
- **`agents:` literal list** → resolve each entry per the rules
  (subagent_type vs custom path). Skip unresolvable entries with a
  warning. If all entries fail, fall back to single-pass with a
  warning.
- **`agents: []`** → force single-pass. Never probe.

Set the resolved-agents list before continuing.

### Step 5: Build per-agent prompts

For each resolved agent, build the prompt per the template in
`references/agents.md`. The prompt includes:

- PR metadata block (title, body, author, baseRef, headRef).
- The unified diff.
- The `focus:` hint (or `(none)`).
- The full guidelines block, **iff** `guidelines_mode in (shared, both)`.
  Otherwise the literal line `(none — guidelines_mode is dedicated)`.
- The agent-specific instruction (its own system prompt for default
  agents; the file body for path-resolved custom agents).
- A reference to `references/findings-schema.md` for the output
  shape.

When `guidelines_mode in (dedicated, both)`, also build a prompt for
the dedicated guidelines-compliance agent per
`references/guidelines-agent.md`. This agent is added to the dispatch
batch alongside the specialists.

### Step 6: Dispatch in parallel

Issue all resolved Task calls in a single turn (multiple Agent tool
blocks in one message). Wait for all to complete before proceeding.

If single-pass fallback is active, run the prompt in
`references/review-prompt.md` once instead — same result shape, one
finding source.

### Step 7: Normalise outputs

Parse each agent's response into the canonical schema documented in
`references/findings-schema.md`. Per-agent normalisation:

- Strict-parse the JSON array. On parse failure, log a one-line
  warning naming the agent and skip its findings — never crash.
- Map each finding's source severity / confidence into our four
  buckets per the table in `findings-schema.md`. Drop findings that
  fall below the lowest bucket.
- Override `reported_by` with the canonical agent name (preventing
  custom agents from claiming a different identity).
- Validate `(file, line)` against the diff — if the agent reported a
  file or line not present in the unified diff, accept the finding
  but log a debug line. Don't drop — agents sometimes flag
  cross-cutting issues that anchor to the closest valid line.

### Step 8: Aggregate

Apply the pipeline in `references/aggregation.md`:

1. Exact-duplicate dedup (always on) — same `(file, line)` plus
   normalised description-hash match → merge to one entry, union
   `reported_by`, keep highest severity.
2. Same-`(file, line)` overlap handling per `finding_overlap`:
   `group` (default) keeps distinct entries; `merge` runs an LLM
   judge to collapse near-duplicates.
3. Severity threshold filter (per finding).
4. (Bot-skim runs at Step 9, post-time only.)
5. Stable sort: severity desc, then `(file, line)` asc, then
   `reported_by[0]` asc.

### Step 9: Branch on mode

#### Auto pipeline (`--pipeline` / `PIPELINE=1`)

- Resolve `output_dir` (default `plans.local/<repo>/`). Ensure the
  directory exists.
- Write findings to `<output_dir>/pr-<N>-auto-review.md` formatted as
  `[?]` items matching the Phase 2 handover schema (see
  `investigate-pr-comments/references/handover-format.md`).
- Persist `severity` and `reported_by` verbatim — emoji prefixing
  happens at post time only, not file-write time.
- Print: `wrote <count> findings to <path>`.
- Do NOT touch GitHub. No `gh pr review`, no `gh pr comment`.

#### Auto standalone (no flag, no env, no `--deep`)

- Same file write as auto pipeline.
- Run bot-skim per `references/aggregation.md` against current PR
  bot comments.
- Apply severity-emoji prefix per the Code-Review-Comment Conventions:
  - `critical` → `🚨 Critical`
  - `important` → `⚠️ Important`
  - `suggestion` / `nit` → `💡 Suggestion`
  - unknown → `⚠️ Important` + warning
- Post each surviving finding as a PR review comment via
  `gh pr review <N> --comment` (or `gh api graphql` for richer
  threading — same approach as `resolve-pr-comments` Step 6).
- Print: `posted <count> comments, suppressed <skim_count> via
bot-skim, wrote findings to <path>`.

#### Deep (`--deep`)

- Skip the file write — deep mode is interactive, not async.
- Run bot-skim before showing the user (suppressed findings still
  surface in a small "skimmed" summary so the user can override).
- Walk each finding interactively. For each: present
  `(file, line)`, severity, description, recommendation, and the
  three options:
  - `(p)` post as-is
  - `(e)` edit the comment text, then post
  - `(d)` drop
- Accept shorthand: `p`, `e`, `d`. Batch responses ("post all
  critical", "drop the rest") are fine.
- After the walk, batch-post agreed findings via a single GraphQL
  `addPullRequestReview` mutation (one review with N inline
  comments). Apply emoji prefixing per the Code-Review-Comment
  Conventions before posting.
- Print: summary of posted / edited / dropped counts.

### Important: bot-skim and emoji prefix are per-finding

A `(file, line)` group with two findings (e.g. critical + suggestion)
can show 🚨 Critical and 💡 Suggestion side by side. If bot-skim
suppresses one, the other still posts. Aggregation grouping is
visual; severity, threshold, and bot-skim are per-finding.

## Mode summary

| Mode            | File write | GitHub post | Bot-skim | Interactive |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| auto pipeline   | yes        | no          | no       | no          |
| auto standalone | yes        | yes         | yes      | no          |
| deep            | no         | yes (batch) | yes      | yes         |

## Important behaviours

- **Pipeline mode is opt-in per repo** — no `.claude/review.yaml`
  means pipeline silently skips. This protects the user from
  surprise reviews when `implement-feature` runs in a repo that
  hasn't been configured.
- **Standalone modes always work** — empty / missing config falls
  back to defaults (no guidelines, all 6 specialists if available,
  single-pass fallback otherwise).
- **Default sub-agent set is the pr-review-toolkit specialists** —
  six parallel specialists give richer signal than one inline pass
  for a small fixed token cost. Graceful fallback when the plugin is
  not installed keeps the skill working out of the box; the info
  line nudges users toward the better experience.
- **Aggregation never silently drops information** — exact dedup is
  always on (no signal lost); `group` mode (default) keeps distinct
  same-line findings as separate entries; `merge` is opt-in for
  users who prefer fewer noisier outputs.
- **Severity emoji and bot-skim happen at post time, not file-write
  time** — the auto-pipeline file is the async hand-off to
  `investigate-pr-comments`; suppressing findings there would hide
  signal from the user's triage. Suppression is for posted PR
  comments only.
- **`findings-schema.md` is the single source of truth** for the
  finding shape. Phase 2's handover format imports from it; do not
  diverge.

## TDD note

A smoke fixture lives under `references/` (see the plan's TDD note —
to be added in a follow-up commit alongside the first end-to-end
run): a recorded review pass over a known small synthetic diff,
asserting the auto-mode file matches the handover schema
byte-for-byte. The diff is intentionally small and synthetic so the
fixture stays stable across model updates.
